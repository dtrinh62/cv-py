# cv-py
Collection of tools and techniques to kick-start analysis of the Covid-19 Research Challenge Dataset

## Why (another) package?
There are many excellent packages in the Python ecosystem for completing NLP tasks. In fact, `cv-py` depends on _many_ of them. 

However, one of the key barriers to rapid NLP analysis and tool development lies in _pipeline construction_... namely, cleaning, data munging, and "gluing together" all the libraries that, united, achieve the decision support we needed in the first place. 

This is not another attempt at collecting techniques together to create another "NLP framework"; rather, `cv-py` provides some of the "glue" needed to allow rapid data and method interaction between the excellent tools that already exist. 

This is done with the express purpose of _contextualization_ within the problem domain of the CORD-19 challenge, and to assist others in the public who are willing and able to apply their data-science skills, but may otherwise spend far more effort applying "glue" than building solutions.
